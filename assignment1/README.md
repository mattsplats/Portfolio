### Week 1, UT Coding Bootcamp: "recommended" assignment - portfolio website

This is my completed Week 1 recommended homework assignment.  All details are made to match the original pictures shown, with the exception of the nav bar being shifted left to accomodate the background transition animation, and the use of slightly different images for the social icons.  Some links do not lead anywhere ( `href = "#"` ) but are still present for completeness.  I used a placeholder image for the About page, perhaps I need some wider selfies!

Additions to the assignment include:
* On-hover background for the nav links
* Reduced opacity of the social links when hovered over (previously scaled them up slightly, but this cause animation jitter in Chrome)
* Color transitions on hovering over the submit button and portfolio "links"

I also used `display: flex` in many places where `float` would have sufficed, to reduce the amount of manual positioning required.
